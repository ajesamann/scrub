> Scrub is a CSS framework that removes the headache of styling large applications.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started with Scrub is by using the CDN to include the following files:

```html
<!-- Scrub CSS -->
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/scrubcss@1.0.4/scss/main.min.css.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>

<!--
  Or,
  Use the following (no variables, supports IE11):
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/scrubcss@1.0.0/scss/main.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
-->

<!-- Scrub JS -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/scrubcss@1.0.4/scss/main.min.css"></script>
```
